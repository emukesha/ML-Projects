This project aims at studying the impact of hyperparameter tuning on the performance of the Neural Networks model that is applied on the data file of credit card applications. It uses Grid Search to perform hyperparameter tuning and 10-fold cross validation to evaluate the model. This study found that hyperparameter tuning significantly improved the performance of the Neural Network model from an accuracy of 0.61 to 0.83, and the study found that the hyperparameters that produces the maximum accuracy for this particular problem are ReLu activation, maximum iteration of 2000, and solver of stochastic gradient descent.
